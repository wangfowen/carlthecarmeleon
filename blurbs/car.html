The Carmeleon started as a 1971 Ford F250 - Camper Special truck. The whole bed and all of the body panels were taken off, leaving only the chassis and engine. On this platform, steel tube will be welded to make a frame which will then have sheet metal welded to the tube frame. The steering rack, shifter, and pedals will be extended with joints to the driving cabin.
