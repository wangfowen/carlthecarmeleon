Carl will be covered by OVER NINE THOUSAND (~15,000) ws2813 LEDs controlled via Artnet. Two PixLite 16 MK II controllers connected to a small PC are used to control all the LEDs to create a moving canvas.

Every exterior surface of the Carmeleon is to be streamlined with densely packed LED strips with approximately 30 LEDs per square foot. The interior of vehicle will have strategically placed LED strips to create an appropriate mood according to the current situation. All edges and corners will also be lit to bring attention to hard surfaces of the vehicle.
Because we will be broadcasting the LEDs via Artnet, we will be allowing visual DJs to connect to our network and show their artwork on the big stage. For visibility and safety, one headlight come out of the mouth of Carl and provide ample light for the driver to see his route.
