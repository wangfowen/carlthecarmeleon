  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p>
We are a group of passionate engineers that like to create big things for the world to see and experience. We found that Burning Man is one of the few places that encourage large-scale art projects for the sake of art.
  </p>

  <p>
We want to create a psychedelic, fun and visually stimulating art car that people can ride, interact with, dance around with, and visual DJ (VJ) to their favourite music.
  </p>

  <p>
Carl the Carmeleon is to be an interactive, dynamic, mobile piece of visual art and music. We took the idea of the colour changing abilities of the chameleon to a fabulous extreme. We will stand out. We covered the entire car in addressable RGB LEDs, controllable by the operators and the passengers of the vehicle. We hope that people will have a lot of fun controlling the lights along to music.
